<h1 style="color:blue"> About myself</h1>
<p>Hi and assalamualaikum, my name is Athirah Abd Razak. People usually call me tira, tirarazak or trex. Im 21 years old. Im from johor. Im studied at UITM Machang Kelantan in Diploma in Information Management in part 5. My father name is Abd Razak Mohammed. He worked under PROTON company while my mother name is Hazizah Bt Mokhtar and worked as housewife. I have 6 siblings and also have two nephew. I lived at Tanjong Malim Perak for 10 years already. Before this i lived at Johor and Selangor. My family always moving house because before this my father worked as policeman. About my studie, when i firts come to Kelantan to continue my study, i feel so scared and sad because i think people there doesnt want to be friend with me because im come from Johor. But, all my thought is wrong, people at Kelantan is very nice to me and i have got many friends and all my friends are from kelantan. Their names are risya, shida, tiya, faten and izlyn. They always support and teach me when i need help. They are so kind and also funny sometime hahaha.We always do crazy things together and have fun together. Its a best momment ever that i have at kelantan.

<p> little short about myself is i love to listen to song, reading horror books, and i also loves so much about old things, something like museum things. Because i would like to know how people in the past go through their life and what they do, what they eat, their tradition and others. Furthermore, now, i worked at my family cafe, Abuya Cafe at tanjong malim perak. For me its quite hard for me to focus at studies and worked but this situation make me want to hard work more because i want to be success in my studies and at the same time success in my worked. For me, its a good experience because i already know much hard to make money nowdays.

Besides that, i also have a dream that when i married to someone, i would like to request for a honeymoon to the place that resemble old thing, old building like italy.
